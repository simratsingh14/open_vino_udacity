# UDACITY OPENVINO EDGE-AI CERTIFIACTION

 This scholorship was provided by Udacity. It was 5-lesson plan which provided insight how to make Edge application which make deeep learning model run locolly on the device. OpenVINVO tool allows us to convert a deep learning model and configure it to run on a specialized hardware.

### Why Edge Application?
Defined as edge computing as “a part of a distributed computing topology in which information processing is located close to the edge – where things and people produce or consume that information.”

#### Infrence from Video
This folder cantains a project which analize the [video](https://github.com/simratsingh14/open_vino_udacity/blob/master/infrences%20fromv%20ideo/pets.mp4)  and return the time two particular set of pets are in camera scene and returns the timestamp when a particular event occours.

File contained are:-
1. model.xml:- xml reprenstaion of Deep Learning Model used as a infrence to model
1. model.bin:- bin reprenstaion of Deep Learning Model
